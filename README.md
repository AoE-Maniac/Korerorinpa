# TankYou

Entry for the [KOM Jam](https://www.kom.tu-darmstadt.de/news-events/game-jams/kom-jam/) and the topic "Experience Points".

Two factions are locked in a brutal war. But with enough experience soldiers might realized that their struggle is pointless - make sure that this does not happen.

Controls:
* Left click to select units from any of the factions
* Right click to issue movement or attack commands
* Mouse or arrow keys to pan view
* Mouse wheel to zoom view

Developed by:
* Polona Caserman
* Robert Konrad
* Lars Lotter
* Max Maag
* Christian Reuter

Background music by Hong Linh Thai and Maria Rumjanzewa.
